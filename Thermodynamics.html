        <h1>Thermodynamics</h1>
        <p>Thermodynamics deals with the concepts of heat and temperature and the inter-conversion of heat and other forms of energy. The four laws of thermodynamics govern the behaviour of these quantities and provide a quantitative description. William Thomson, in 1749, coined the term thermodynamics.</p>
        <h2>What is Thermodynamics?</h2>
        <p>To be specific, it explains how thermal energy is converted to or from other forms of energy and how matter is affected by this process. Thermal energy is the energy that comes from heat. This heat is generated by the movement of tiny particles within an object, and the faster these particles move, the more heat is generated.</p>

        <p>Thermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what rate these energy transformations are carried out. It is based on the initial and final states undergoing the change. It should also be noted that Thermodynamics is a macroscopic science. This means that it deals with the bulk system and does not deal with the molecular constitution of matter.</p>
        <h2>Different Branches of Thermodynamics</h2>
        <P>Thermodynamics is classified into the following four branches:</P>
        <h3>Classical Thermodynamics</h3>
        <p>In classical thermodynamics, the behaviour of matter is analysed with a macroscopic approach. Units such as temperature and pressure are taken into consideration, which helps the individuals calculate other properties and predict the characteristics of the matter undergoing the process.</p>
        <h3>Statistical Thermodynamics</h3> 
        <p>In statistical thermodynamics, every molecule is under the spotlight, i.e. the properties of every molecule and how they interact are taken into consideration to characterise the behaviour of a group of molecules.</p>
        <h3>Chemical Thermodynamics</h3> 
        <p>Chemical thermodynamics is the study of how work and heat relate to each other in chemical reactions and in changes of states.</p>
        <h3>Equilibrium Thermodynamics</h3>
        <p>Equilibrium thermodynamics is the study of transformations of energy and matter as they approach the state of equilibrium.</p>
